        \large\textbf{Stem Summer Camp: Python} \\
        Shipping Calculator \\

    \end{center}

    \paragraph{Purpose:} After completing this assignment, you will be
    able to:

        \begin{itemize}

            \item Make use of Python variables to store values

            \item Demonstrate how to use if statements in Python

        \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Task:} Write a program that asks the user the enter a
    shipping weight of a package and calculates the shipping cost based
    on the package weight.
    
    \paragraph{Discussion:} Use the following guidelines to determine
    the shipping cost:

    \begin{itemize}

        \item If the package weighs less than 2lbs, the shipping cost is
            \$1.15 per pound

        \item If the package weighs between 2lbs and 10lbs inclusive,
            the shipping cost is \$2.27 per pound

        \item if the package weighs more than 10lbs, the shipping cost
            is a flat-rate of \$30

    \end{itemize}
    
    The program must run as follows:
    
    \vspace{1.5em}

\begin{verbatim}
$ python shippingCost.py
Enter the package weight: 7
The shipping cost is $15.89
$

$ python shippingCost.py
Enter the package weight: 12
The shipping cost is $30
$
\end{verbatim}
